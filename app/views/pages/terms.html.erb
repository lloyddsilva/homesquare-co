        <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the services and HomeSquare's websites (“Services”), and any information, text, graphics, or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as “Content”). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <br/>

        <h4>Terms of use</h4>
        <p>This site is owned and operated by Home Square Labs Pte. Ltd. ("HomeSquare") which is a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore. HomeSquare may change the Terms of Use at any time by posting changes online and you agree to be legally bound by these Terms as updated and/or amended.</p><br />

        <h4>The Service</h4>
        <p>The Services that HomeSquare provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, HomeSquare may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.</p>

        <p>We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you. The Services may include advertisements, which may be targeted to the Content or Information on the Services, queries made through the Services, or other information. The types and extent of advertising by HomeSquare on the Services are subject to change.</p>

        <p>In consideration for HomeSquare granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that HomeSquare and its third party providers and partners may page such advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services whether submitted by you or others.</p>

        <br />

        <h4>Accepting the Terms</h4>
        <p>In order to use the Services, you must firstly agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.</p>

        <p>You can accept the Terms by: clicking to accept or agree to the Terms; or using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that HomeSquare will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>

        <p>You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if you are not 18; or you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of Singapore or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.</p>

        <br />

        <h4>Sharing Your Content and Information</h4>
        <p>You own all of the content and information you post on HomeSquare, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.</p>

        <p>In addition: For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with HomeSquare ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others). When you publish content using parts of the Services which are available to everyone, it means that you are allowing everyone, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (e.g. your name and profile picture).</p>

        <h4>Reporting Spam</h4>
        <p>Spam is unsolicited commercial email, that is email which has not been requested by the recipient. Spam messages are the opposite of permission-based emails which are normally anticipated, personal, relevant, and/or associated with a pre-existing business or personal relationship. All emails sent by HomeSquare are permission-based. If you believe you received unsolicited email from HomeSquare, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to info@homesquare.co for review.</p>
        <p>Messages we send to you are legitimate messages and not spam. If you report a legitimate message as spam, you may be guilty of making a false spam report, which is likely to be in violation of the terms and conditions imposed on you by your email provider or ISP.</p>

        <br />

        <h4>False Spam Reporting</h4>
        <p>We fully support the efforts of various organizations which work to responsibly eliminate spam activities. However, if you have opted-in to receive email from us and/or have supplied your email address by creating a HomeSquare Account or joining one of our mailing lists, and then falsely or maliciously file a spam complaint against us, we will cooperate fully with the appropriate agencies and file a false spam report incident with the proper authorities. We may also suspend or delete your HomeSquare Account without notice.</p>

        <br />

        <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This Agreement may only be modified as set forth herein.</p>
        <p>This Statement makes up the entire agreement between the parties regarding HomeSquare, and supersedes any prior agreements. If any portion of this Statement is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of this Statement, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of this Statement must be made in writing and signed by us. You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Statement to anyone else without our consent. All of our rights and obligations under this Statement are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. Nothing in this Statement shall prevent us from complying with the law. This Statement does not confer any third party beneficiary rights.</p>
        <p>The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.</p>
